# Terms of Use

## 1. Introduction

These Terms of Use, including our Privacy Policy ("Terms"), govern your access to and use of the **Landlords Co mobile application** ("App") provided by Karma Academy Pty Ltd (ACN [Insert ACN], "we," "us," or "our"), registered in Australia.

By downloading, accessing, or using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms, which form a legally binding agreement between you and us. If you do not agree to these Terms, you must not use the App.

These Terms apply to all users, including visitors, registered users, and subscribers. **You must be at least 18 years old to use the App.**

## 2. The App

The App provides property investment education, landlord resources, and tools (e.g., Receiptly) to assist users in managing property-related activities.

We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue any part of the App at any time without notice, subject to applicable law.

## 3. Subscription Payments, Renewals, and Cancellation

### 3.1 Subscription Plans

Certain features of the App require a paid subscription ("Subscription"). Subscriptions are billed on a recurring basis ("Billing Cycle"), typically monthly, through your Apple ID via the App Store. The subscription fee will be disclosed at the time of purchase.

### 3.2 Automatic Renewal

Your Subscription will automatically renew at the end of each Billing Cycle under the same conditions unless canceled at least 24 hours before the current Billing Cycle ends. Your Apple ID will be charged for the renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current Billing Cycle.

### 3.3 Managing Subscriptions

You may manage or cancel your Subscription through your App Store account settings. We do not directly manage cancellations or provide invoices for Subscriptions; these are handled by the App Store. To view your account balance or transaction history, check your App Store account settings.

### 3.4 Trial Subscriptions

We may offer a free trial period during which you can access all App features for a limited time. If you do not cancel before the trial period ends, your Apple ID will be charged according to the Subscription terms. Trial details, including duration, will be provided at sign-up.

## 4. Fee Changes

We may modify Subscription fees at our sole discretion. Any changes will be communicated to you at least 30 days in advance via email or in-app notification. If you do not agree to the new fees, you may cancel your Subscription before the next Billing Cycle. Continued use of the App after a fee change constitutes acceptance of the new fees.

## 5. Refunds and Billing Disputes

All Subscription purchases are processed by the App Store and are subject to their refund policies. We do not issue refunds directly for purchases charged to your Apple ID. If you have a billing dispute, contact the App Store to seek a resolution.

Under Australian Consumer Law, you may be entitled to remedies for services that do not meet consumer guarantees (e.g., if the App is not of acceptable quality). Contact us (see Section 13) to discuss such issues.

## 6. User Obligations

By using the App, you agree to:

- Provide accurate, current, and complete information when creating an account or using our services.
- Maintain the security of your account credentials and notify us immediately of any unauthorized access.
- Use the App only for lawful purposes and in compliance with these Terms.
- Not reproduce, distribute, or modify any part of the App without our written consent.

## 7. Intellectual Property

The App, including its content, design, and underlying software, is owned by or licensed to Karma Academy Pty Ltd and is protected by Australian and international intellectual property laws.

You are granted a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the App for personal, non-commercial purposes, subject to these Terms. You may not copy, modify, reverse-engineer, or distribute any part of the App.

## 8. Disclaimer of Warranties

To the maximum extent permitted by law, the App is provided **"AS IS"** and **"AS AVAILABLE"** without warranties of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement.

We do not guarantee that:

- The App will be uninterrupted, secure, or error-free.
- Any defects will be corrected.
- The App is free of viruses or other harmful components.
- The App will meet your expectations or requirements.

Nothing in these Terms excludes or limits consumer guarantees under the Australian Consumer Law where such exclusion would be unlawful.

## 9. Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by law, Karma Academy Pty Ltd, its subsidiaries, affiliates, and licensors will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising from or related to your use of the App, including loss of data, profits, or business opportunities.

Our total liability for any claim will not exceed the amount you paid for your Subscription in the 12 months prior to the claim.

Under Australian Consumer Law, you may be entitled to remedies for breaches of consumer guarantees that cannot be excluded. This section does not limit those rights.

## 10. Termination

We may suspend or terminate your access to the App at our discretion, with or without notice, if you breach these Terms or engage in conduct that we deem harmful to the App or other users.

You may terminate your account by canceling your Subscription and discontinuing use of the App.

Upon termination:

- Your license to use the App ends.
- We may delete your account data, subject to our Privacy Policy and legal obligations.

## 11. Changes to These Terms

We may update these Terms at any time to reflect changes in our practices or legal requirements. We will notify you of material changes via email, in-app notification, or by posting the updated Terms on our website at least 30 days before they take effect.

Your continued use of the App after the changes become effective constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms. If you do not agree, you must stop using the App.

## 12. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution

These Terms are governed by the laws of New South Wales, Australia. Any disputes arising from or related to these Terms or the App will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of New South Wales.

If you have a concern, please contact us first (see Section 13). We will attempt to resolve disputes informally. If the matter remains unresolved, you may pursue remedies under Australian Consumer Law or through the courts, as applicable.

## 13. Contact Us

## 14. Miscellaneous

**Entire Agreement:** These Terms, together with our Privacy Policy, constitute the entire agreement between you and us regarding the App.

**Severability:** If any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will continue in full force.

**No Waiver:** Our failure to enforce any right or provision does not constitute a waiver of that right or provision.

**Assignment:** We may assign our rights and obligations under these Terms to a third party (e.g., in a business sale). You may not assign your rights without our written consent.
